When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
When collaborating on projects or sharing my own repository between multiple computers.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay 
up-to-date with your remote repository?
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Say you are working on an experimental change appart from the master branch and then suddently
someone makes an update to the remote repository master branch, then youre experimental branch
would be merged with the master unless changes were routet to the appropriate repsitory.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. 
When would you use one instead of another?
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In the context of git Fork is available only on Github, when you don't have any permissions to
change a remote repository belonging to someone else github lets you fork there repository
into you own git account if the repository is public. Github fork also takes care off credits
to the owner off the repository from where the fork was made. Clones can be used to copy a
repository from any remote source it could also be a local source. The result of performing
a clone is a local repository corresponding to the cloned one. Branches could exist both on
github and locally. A branch is more of a way to label commits with common ancesters.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The local last known remote state lets you see the difference in commits between your local rep 
and the remote rep at the time the remote state was updated. Each time you make a local commit
you only update the branch label (EX. master), The remote/master label will still reference the
same commit until another pull/push or fetch is performed. Having a remote reference provied a
way of determin either local or remote differences like when you have a branch and you know the
commit befor the branch was created.
