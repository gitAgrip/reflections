What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

git created hitten metadata, it is neccessary to tell git to keep track of the files in that particular folder. 


How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

It differs becase it only contain changes. This is a good function to have because it makes it simple to splite up larger commits into smaller commits. 

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
You can partially add pieces instead of having to save all the changes at once.
