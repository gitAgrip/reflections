What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

git created hitten metadata, it is neccessary to tell git to keep track of the files in that particular folder. 


How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

It differs becase it does not contain any of the files in the working directory unless we decide otherwise. This is a good function to have because it makes it simple to splite up larger commits into smaller commits.
